Features: 
Days per month - how many days the month had
Group - larger categories, i.e. merging video games for all systems into a Games category
First month sold - identifying what month the item first sold, if any
Number of months since last sale - how long it has been since the item sold 
Lag means: 
Item average sales, lagging 1, 2, 3, and 12 months
Shop average sales, lagging 1, 2, 3, and 12 months
Item category sales, lagging 1, 2, 3, and 12 months
Item average sales per shop, lagging 1, 2, 3, and 12 months
Item category sales per shop, lagging 1, 2, 3, and 12 months


Parameters: 
All values default. 


Hyperparameters:
I used CART and XGB models after analyzing 5 total models by their RMSE score. 
CART: max_depth: 6, max_features: 0.8, min_samples_leaf: 0.04 
XGB: max_depth: 4, max_features: log2, min_samples_leaf: 0.01, n_estimators: 200


Performance metrics: 
I used time-series cross-validation and the best RMSE values during cross-validation training and tuning were as follows:
CART: 0.890
XGB: 0.306

After uploading to the Kaggle competition, the RMSE scores were as follows: 
CART: 1.25011
XGB: 1.23691
Averaged: 1.24313

The best score is XGB.
